    <p>As time went on C.J. grew to love earth.In his explorations he met someone named Goldy. She was lovely and enjoyed dancing and playing music on her radio. He soon learned that he could actually attach a phone to Goldy's radio and get in contact with home. He now had two homes he loved. Ultimately he loved earth so much he chose to stay with Goldy, but he kept in touch with home and would sometimes visit.</p>
